# In Search of Pi: A general introduction to reinforcement learning

This talk presented an overview of reinforcement learning, to an audience who was familiar with supervised learning and statistics (by mostly hadn't encounted RL before).

The outline of the talk:

* Background
* Some motivating examples
* The simplest case: a multi-armed bandit
* Models
* Methods
* Open source code
* References

Note: This talk is somewhat dated at this stage.  The open source code, in particular, was very poor a few years ago, but now we have https://www.openai.com/ which provides a suite of amazing tools.
