# Talks
Code and latex from some of the talks that I've given in the past, covering topics to do with machine learning and programming.  

Currently includes:

* "An Introduction to Planning with Reinforcement Learning" (September, 2014): https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/205980522/
* "Probably Approximately Correct: A Very Brief Tour of All of Machine Learning" (March, 2017): http://www.sqa-us.org/?page=FuzzyDay2017

I will try to add older talks, which discussed features of R, Clojure, and Julia.

Any feedback is welcome.  I tried to attribute all materials, but please let me know if I missed anything.
