# Probably Approximately Correct: A Very Brief Tour of All of Machine Learning

This talk was intended to provide a shallow overview of the field of machine learning for an audience who (on average) had very little exposure to the topic but were quantitatively sophisticated.  The talk also provided a reference for references throughout the rest of the conference.

The talk follows a rough outline:

* Introduction: what is machine learning
* In Theory: PAC learning
* In Practice: how does machine learning get applied
* Overview of different models:
  * Supervised learning
  * Unsupervised learning
  * Reinforcement learning
* Meta-models: ensembles and meta-learning
* Conclusion
